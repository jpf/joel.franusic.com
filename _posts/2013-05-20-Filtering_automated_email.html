<p>A great way to clean up your email inbox is to filter email from automated systems into a special folder. I have a folder called "Notifications" for this type of email. I check that folder once a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that most automated email comes from a relatively small number of addresses. If you set up filters for the addresses below, the vast majority of automated email that you receive will not hit your inbox:</p>
<ul><li>noreply@</li>
<li>no-reply@</li>
<li>donotreply@ </li>
<li>info@</li>
<li>newsletter@</li>
<li>marketing@</li>
<li>support@ </li>
<li>contact@ </li>
</ul>
