    <li>Visit <a href="https://www.myopenid.com">www.myopenid.com</a></li>
    <li>
        Click on the "SIGN IN TO YOUR ACCOUNT" button:
        <p><img src="assets/Welcome_to_myOpenID.jpg" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>Log in to your account.</li>
    <li>
        Click on the "Account Settings" link on the right side of the page:
        <p><img src="assets/Welcome_to_myOpenID-1.jpg" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on the "Authentication Settings" link in the sub-menu that opens up:
        <p><img src="assets/Settings.jpg" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>Scroll down to the "ADD AN SSL CLIENT CERTIFICATE" section of the "Authentication Settings" page.</li>
    <li>
        Enter something to identify your computer into the "Name" field.
        I like to use the type of computer and browser that I'm using as an identifier.
       For example: "pbwiki-firefox".
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on the "Create Certificate" button.
        <p><img src="assets/Settings-1.jpg" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        What happens next depends on your browser.
        Firefox and IE seem to handle client side
        SSL certificate generation smoothly.
        If you are using Safari you'll have to
        follow the instructions and install the
        certificate that is generated for you.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you've generated and imported a
        client side SSL certificate into your
        browser, you should be able to test it
        out by clicking on "Sign out" and then
        trying to log back in.
        You'll know if it works if
        you see a page like this when you
        try to sign back in:
        <p><img src="assets/Sign_In_with_an_SSL_Certificate-1.jpg" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>If you see a page like the one above, then it works! No more passwords!</li>
