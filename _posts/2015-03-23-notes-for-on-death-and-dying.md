[On Death and Dying](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684842238/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0684842238&linkCode=as2&tag=joelfran-20&linkId=TL5H4GUXRI6XLEAH)
is a book that "brought about a radical restructuring of patients’ relationships with their doctors and other clinicians". If you've heard about the “[five stages of grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model#Stages)", this book is where that model came from.

Indeed, this book was so influential that, according to the introduction to my version of the book:

<div class="clipping">
<span class="content">
<p class="highlight">by the late 1990s pain would become a “fifth vital sign” to be assessed in hospitals every time a patient’s temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respirations were measured.</p>

The best parts of this book are the many transcribed interviews that it contains. My highlights consist mostly of the comments or summaries that Kübler-Ross had on these interviews. However, the interviews themselves are what make the book. 

My highlights on this book fall into a few categories:

1. Insights into the modern views of death
2. The importance of facing our own mortality
3. How to interact with the dying
4. Closing thoughts from the author

## Insights into the modern views of death

<div class="clipping">
<span class="content">
<p class="highlight">The more we are making advancements in science, the more we seem to fear and deny the reality of death. How is this possible?</p>
</span>

</ul>
</span>
</span>
</div>

<div class="clipping">
<span class="content">
<p class="highlight">I think there are many reasons for this flight away from facing death calmly. One of the most important facts is that dying nowadays is more gruesome in many ways, namely, more lonely, mechanical, and dehumanized;</p>

<li>250</li>
</ul>
</span>
</span>
</div>

Another insight from the book, that I wasn't able to capture in a highlight, is that advances in science have made dying harder. It's more rare for someone to accept death in our modern age, because a "cure" could legitimacy be around the corner.

<div class="clipping">
<span class="content">
<p class="highlight">In simple terms, in our unconscious mind we can only be killed; it is inconceivable to die of a natural cause or of old age. Therefore death in itself is associated with a bad act, a frightening happening, something that in itself calls for retribution and punishment.</p>

</ul>
</span>
</span>
</div>

<div class="clipping">
<span class="content">
<p class="highlight">man has not basically changed. Death is still a fearful, frightening happening, and the fear of death is a universal fear even if we think we have mastered it on many levels. What has changed is our way of coping and dealing with death and dying and our dying patients.</p>

## The importance of facing our own mortality

<div class="clipping">
<span class="content">
<p class="highlight">Each one of us has the need to avoid this issue, yet each one of us has to face it sooner or later. If all of us could make a start by contemplating the possibility of our own personal death, we may effect many things, most important of all the welfare of our patients, our families, and finally perhaps our nation.</p>
